# Facial Recognition Neural Network

## Overview

This repository contains a facial recognition neural network implemented using the Keras library. The convolutional neural network is designed to classify facial expressions into different categories such as sad, angry, happy, etc. The code utilizes various libraries, including Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Brewer2mpl. This algorithm was able to reach over an 80% accuracy. Please view the code files for further analysis of the accuracy through other performance metrics. Currently, a user interface is being made using OpenCV that will allow users to have emotion recognition done in real-time. 

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure to install the required libraries using Poetry. If you don't have Poetry installed, you can follow the installation instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-recognition-neural-network.git
cd facial-recognition-neural-network
```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script in your preferred development environment.

3. Run the code cells or execute the script to train and test the facial recognition neural network.

## Installation

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the dependencies using Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will read the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files to set up the virtual environment and install the required packages.

## Usage

The facial recognition neural network is trained on a dataset of facial expressions. The model can be fine-tuned or further optimized based on specific requirements.
